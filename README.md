# azvm-tf-hello
Deploy a simple Node hello.js to Azure VM using Terraform

## Deploy Steps:

Follow the steps provided in the Hello NodeJs App document. 
You must always end the deployment with "terraform destroy".
If that does not work, you must remove the resource group (RG).
(a) Azure CLI: az group delete "<name>"
(b) Azure Portal: 
    - Navigate to list of RGs
    - Select nodejs-app-rg
    - Delete RG
    - Enter name: nodejs-app-rg
    - Delete
(c) Repeat either (a) or (b) for NetworkWatcherRG

## Important: First, learn the deployment steps with 
- size = "Standard_F1" # Free tier VM size
Then, for presentation and testing, replace the size with:
- size = "Standard_B1s"  # Recommended tier for light workloads
